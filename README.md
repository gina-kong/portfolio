# Winbook or Macdows?
Welcome to my portfolio website! I wanted my portfolio to be a bit more exciting, so I created an interactive ✨experience✨ to showcase my skills and projects!
Don't get me wrong, I love a clean minimal UI, but I wanted my debut project to be more exciting. So, here is my desktop themed website that blends styles from
 popular operating systems to create a modern, yet retro, new, yet familiar interface.

## Features
- **Application Dock**: At the bottom of the page, you'll find a dock with clickable application icons that open up real sections of my portfolio, including:
- **Finder/Explorer**:
- **Notepad**: Yes, I've build a fully-functional notepad that you can use right on the site! Type away, format your text with different font sizes and colours, and even export a file to your own desktop.

## Technologies Used
- Framework: React
- Language: JavaScript
- Styling: HTML, CSS
- UI Libraries: Ant Design

## Why This Portfolio?
This project reflects my passion for creative, user-centred design with a functional twist. It's a blend of both technical skill and visual appeal, and it's all about giving you an immersive and engaging experience.
Whether you're interested in learning more about my professional background or just want to have fun with the notepad, I hope you enjoy your time here!

Feel free to explore, interact, and reach out if you'd like to connect. I'd love to hear your feedback and chat about all things tech or even collaborating in the future!
